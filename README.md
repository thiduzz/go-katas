# go-katas

So, it all started one day, when I got a bit bored and started reading articles about Golang and how awesome it was. 
My initial thought was like: "Ha! I am gonna try to create an API with it to give it a go!" and so I did. Managed to put a DB layer and scaffold the base of a Gin Gonic application. All went pretty smooth and I liked how it worked - it felt like working with Laravel at some points (weird?). But yeah...that was it. I got the confirmation that I wanted, it's cool and it seems powerful. 

I thought about getting myself a course but I wanna learn this by myself - I want to understand this well now. Then I found Gophercises: https://gophercises.com - So, my goal within this repo is to resolve all of the exercises on my own - hopefully without consulting the videos. I am gonna try to also do it following, what I understand, TDD for Golang. Appreciate my struggle.
